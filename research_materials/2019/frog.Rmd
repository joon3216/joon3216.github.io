# 1. Introduction

This is to illustrate the "jumping frog" Markov chain [^1] using `gganimate` package.

# 2. A jumping frog


Say there is a frog jumping across 20 lily pads numbered from 1 to 20 which are arranged clockwise in a circle. Suppose $X_n$ is the pad number at the $n$^th^ jump. Let's define the "jumping frog" Markov chain $\{ X_n \}_{n = 0}^{\infty}$ as a Markov chain whose state space is $S = \{ 1, 2, \dots, 20\}$, with the initial state $X_0 = 20$ and initial probabilities $v_{20} = P(X_0 = 20) = 1$ and $v_s = 0 \text{ }$ for all $s = 1, \dots, 19$, and trainsition probabilities $p_{ij} = P(X_n = j \text{ | } X_{n - 1} = i)= \frac{1}{3}$ whenever $j = i - 1, i$, or $i + 1$.

Long story short, a [Java Applet regarding this frogwalk](http://probability.ca/jeff/java/frogwalk.html) written by [Prof. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/) at the University of Toronto doesn't work anymore. This is the effort to simulate this Markov chain using R and `gganimate` package.


With initial parameters below, we can simulate this Markov chain and populate `X` with some generated $X_n$'s:

```{r frog_pad_generator}
set.seed(1024)

# Settings
max_iter <- 1000 # The maximum n
number_of_pads <- 20
initial_state <- 20
p_ij = rep(1, 3) / 3 # Prob of moving left, staying, and moving right

# Populate X
state_space <- 1:number_of_pads
cmf_p_ij = cumsum(p_ij)
X <- NULL
X[1] <- state_space[initial_state] # initial state
for (i in 2:(max_iter + 1)) {
    choice <- runif(1) # choice ~ Unif(0, 1)
    if (0 <= choice && choice < cmf_p_ij[1]) { # move left
        if (X[i - 1] == number_of_pads) {
            X[i] <- 1
        } else {
            X[i] <- X[i - 1] + 1 
        }
    } else if (cmf_p_ij[1] <= choice && choice < cmf_p_ij[2]) { # stay
        X[i] <- X[i - 1]
    } else { # move right
        if (X[i - 1] == 1) {
            X[i] <- number_of_pads
        } else {
            X[i] <- X[i - 1] - 1
        }
    }
}
```

`state_df` will be used to create a tibble that indicates the pad number the frog is located at each iteration. `state_space` will be used as x-axis, `pads_point` as y-axis (which is just a dummy), and `iterations` as a facetting variable:

```{r polar_pad}
state_df <- tibble(
  iterations = rep(
    0:max_iter, 
    each = number_of_pads
  ),
  state_space = rep(state_space, max_iter + 1),
  pads_point = rep(1, number_of_pads * (max_iter + 1))
)
```

`comparison_df` is a tibble that acutally indicates where the frog is at at each iteration. `state_space` and `iterations` will be variables that `state_df` and `comparison_df` have in common, and `value` will be an indicator:

```{r polar_pad2}
comparison_df <- tibble(state_space)
for (i in 1:(max_iter + 1)) {
  mutating_code <- paste0(
    "comparison_df <- comparison_df %>% ",
    "mutate(`", i - 1, "` = state_space == X[i])"
  )
  eval(parse(text = mutating_code))
}
comparison_df <- comparison_df %>% 
    gather(iterations, value, -state_space) %>%
    mutate(iterations = as.integer(iterations))
```

We shall now `left_join` `state_df` and `comparison_df` using `state_space` and `iterations` columns, and create the whole `states_df` that is ready for generating a .gif file:

```{r polar_pad3}
states_df <- state_df %>%
    left_join(comparison_df, by = c("state_space", "iterations"))
```

In our `gganimate` usage, we are basically creating a fast slide show of all the facets. `iterations` is our facetting variable, which is used in `transition_time`. Whenever the frog is located at the pad, the image will denote such a state with a red dot, and the rest of the pads will be coloured as black.

```{r anim_in_disguise, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
anim <- ggplot(
    states_df, 
    aes(
        x = factor(state_space), y = pads_point, 
        color = value
    )
) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
    coord_polar(start = .15) +
    labs(title = "Iteration: {frame_time}", x = "", y = "") +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    transition_time(iterations) +
    enter_drift() + 
    exit_drift()
```

```{r animation, warning = F, message = F, eval = F}
anim <- ggplot(
    states_df, 
    aes(
        x = factor(state_space), y = pads_point, 
        color = value
    )
) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red")) +
    coord_polar(start = .15) +
    labs(title = "Iteration: {frame_time}", x = "", y = "") +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    transition_time(iterations) +
    enter_drift() + 
    exit_drift()
states_gif <- animate(
  anim, fps = 20,
  duration = 78,
  start_pause = 2,
  end_pause = 2
)
anim_save('frog.gif', states_gif)
```

Here's the .gif file:

```{r frog_fast, fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics('frog.gif')
```

Here's a slower version (it takes a bit of time to load... 6 seconds?):

```{r frog_slow, warning = F, message = F, fig.align = 'center', eval = F}
states_gif2 <- animate(
  anim, fps = 20,
  duration = 226,
  start_pause = 2,
  end_pause = 2
)
anim_save('frog_slower.gif', states_gif2)
include_graphics('frog_slower.gif')
```

```{r frog_slow2, fig.align = 'center', echo = F}
include_graphics('frog_slower.gif')
```

If your sole purpose is to display, then saving the image file and using `include_graphics()` is unnecessary. For that purpose, you can just use `animate()`.
