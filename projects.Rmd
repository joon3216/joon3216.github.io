## Publishing this [website](https://joon3216.github.io)

The challenge is to learn about HTML and CSS to make my website look like a website. Also, I am learning some git commands for a better management of files in the [repository](https://github.com/joon3216/joon3216.github.io). See [here](projects/2019/publishing_website.html) for details.
